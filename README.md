### What is the Game of Life ?

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

### Credits

This was hacked together overnight using [React](https://reactjs.org) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org) with the help of the below resources.

* The overall design is inspired by [this](https://playgameoflife.com) version created by [Edwin Martin](https://bitstorm.org).
* [This](https://dev.to/christiankastner/integrating-p5-js-with-react-i0d) tutorial on integrating p5.js with React.
* The basic gameplay algorithm is from [The Game of Life](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-game-of-life.html) example on [p5js.org](p5js.org).
* Special Thanks to [Jikku Jose](http://github.com/JikkuJose/) for the challenge.
